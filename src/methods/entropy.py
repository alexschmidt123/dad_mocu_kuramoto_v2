ENTROPY OED Method

Simple heuristic-based method that selects experiments with maximum uncertainty.
Selects the pair (i, j) with the largest uncertainty bandwidth: max(a_upper - a_lower)

This method does NOT use any prediction model - it's purely based on current bounds.

In the paper: "ENTROPY" method
